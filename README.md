## Introduction

This repository contains notes, code, and projects related to my journey in mastering Natural Language Processing (NLP). The content is organized from basic concepts to advanced techniques, along with practical applications and projects.

I am currently enrolled in a comprehensive ML and NLP course taught by Krish Naik, where I aim to deepen my understanding and skills in NLP.
